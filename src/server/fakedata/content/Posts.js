    "title": "Estonia Clarifies Upcoming Regulations, Will Not Ban Crypto Holding or Trading",
    "content": "The government of Estonia has approved legislation tailored to improve oversight of its crypto sector which expanded rapidly due to favorable regulations and business climate. The new law which is yet to be adopted will introduce stricter requirements for service providers without preventing their clients from owning or exchanging cryptocurrencies. Authorities in Tallinn Draft Stricter Rules for Crypto Service ProvidersThe executive power in Estonia has prepared and approved draft legislation designed to more effectively regulate virtual asset service providers VASPs. The main goal the Finance Ministry explained on Sunday is to mitigate the risk of financial crime through the crypto platforms registered and operating out of the Baltic nation.The new regulations which come in the form of a revised draft law submitted to the Estonian parliament require VASPs to identify their customers in a way that would link them to their transactions. The regulations expand upon the ban on open anonymous virtual accounts introduced in 2020 after Estonias cryptofriendly regulations attracted numerous license applicants.The Ministry of Finance pointed out that the legislation will not affect individuals who own virtual currency through a private wallet that is not provided by a VASP. It does not prohibit customers from holding and trading virtual assets and does not require them to share the private keys to their crypto wallets. At the same time Estonian service providers will not be allowed to offer anonymous accounts or wallets.The department emphasized that the measures are similar to the rules applied to payment and banking transactions. The amendments transpose the recommendations issued by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering FATF into Estonian law. These define some virtual asset services that are not defined under Estonias current legislation.Estonia to Raise Capital Requirements for Crypto LicenseesAn important aspect of the new regulation is the requirement for companies to operate or be connected to Estonia in order to obtain its licenses. The boom in applications was largely due to the current rules allowing the resale of Estonialicensed companies to third parties. The supervision of such entities has proved unfeasible and authorities noted that under the new rules the countrys Financial Intelligence Unit FIU will be able to decline such applications.Furthermore regulators will raise share capital requirements for VASPs from x20AC12000 to x20AC125000 or x20AC350000 depending on the type of services. The Estonian government hopes that the threshold will reduce the number of dormant entities. The Finance Ministry also said the average annual turnover of licensed VASPs is now around x20AC80 million euros.Estonia announced its working on the new legislation in October when the head of FIU Matis MxE4eker revealed in an interview that only one in 10 licensed crypto companies has a bank account in the country adding that the regulator is considering revoking all previously issued licenses to restart authorization. By that time the agency had revoked around 2000 licenses of virtual asset service providers such as crypto exchanges and wallet operators.Do you expect Estonia to adopt the stricter regulations for its crypto industry Tell us in the comments section below.

    "content": "The number of ATMs in Spain has been progressively shrinking to levels the country saw in the year 2002. Reports from local media suggest these actions have been taken to reduce costs and to push payment and operation digitalization in the sector. The highest number of ATMs was registered in 2008 when there were 61714 active machines in the network.13Banks in Spain Reduce ATMs13The number of ATMs in Spain has dropped to its lowest level since 2002 when the network had 1795 more ATMs than it has today. According to a recent report from the Bank of Spain the network had 48081 ATMs at the end of the third quarter of 2021. This reduction has to do with attempts to lower costs in the banking sector amidst a push for digitalization in payments and banking processes.13The highest number of ATMs in the network was registered in 2008 when there were 61714 ATMs registered in the country. Since then banks have progressively removed machines from this network. However utilization of the remaining ATMs has gone up according to the same report. Just in Q32021 Spaniards made 171300 withdrawal transactions using ATMs an increase of 1.04 compared to the same period in 2020.1313The Push for Digitalization13The Spanish government has been reducing the amount of money that can be paid in cash per transaction. Last year Spains antifraud law which also regulated some issues regarding cryptocurrency assets passed controls for cash payments depending on the type of transaction. The aforementioned law established that payments in cash could only be made up to the limit of x20AC1000. Sidestepping this law could result in sanctions of 25 of the payments made which would be paid by each party to the transaction.13However local media states these developments could disproportionately affect Spanish citizens in rural areas who are the ones that depend most on cash for their everyday needs.13The recent push has driven more and more residents of the country to digital payments. For example the national survey for cash payments carried out July 2021 found that only 35 of the surveyed citizens used cash for payments. This constitutes a significant change compared to how payments were made in 2014 where 80 of citizens used cash as a payments tool.13While cash usage has gone down Spain still uses more cash for payments than countries like Sweden where less than 10 of the population uses physical paper and coins to pay.13What do you think about the reduction in ATMs and the push for digital payments in Spain Tell us in the comments section below.13",

    "title": "Decentralized Storage Provider Says It’s Too Risky for the World to Rely Centralized Cloud Storage Platforms",
    "content": "In the past year internet giants like Amazon and Google all experienced outages which were blamed on errors and failed upgrades. The occurrence of such outages and their impact around the world again highlighted the importance of having a decentralized internet. 1313Also just like how the Covid19 pandemic showed the world that blockchainbased digital currencies are the future the outages suffered by the powerful internet companies may have given an impetus to those that champion the Web3.0.1313However this Web3.0 can really take off if players in this ecosystem play their part in building the critical infrastructure. That is what Lucky Uwakwe the cofounder of Stoor says he is attempting through the startups blockchainbased cloud storage service.1313In a question and answer interview with Bitcoin.com News Nigeria based Uwakwe explains the concept of decentralized cloud storage and how the blockchain makes this kind of storage possible. He also shares thoughts about the trajectory of Web3.0 and why he thinks the world is now ready for this next stage of the internet. Below are Uwakwes written responses to questions sent to him.1313Bitcoin.com News Can you explain this concept of blockchain decentralized cloud storage1313Lucky Uwakwe The concept of decentralized cloud storage is basically utilizing the benefit of blockchain decentralized cloud storage. Unlike centralized databases the existing decentralized cloud storage systems were designed to take advantage of the blockchain by incorporating the following features that are an improvement from the traditional cloud storage providers1313Decentralized systems ensure that the cloud storage is distributed across many computers and in multiple locations. Hackers would have a more challenging time accessing large amounts of data so they can seldom go down. This also means that no single government or institution can interfere with the blockchain as long as other servers are running the database outside their jurisdiction.1313They are designed to run with the input of every user of the network which is to say peers in the system can share information without requiring a central administrators supervision or approval. They incentivize users to participate in the network by encouraging them to provide unused storage on their devices and earn money from this.1313They take advantage of unused hard drive space from devices all across the world to establish a data storage marketplace that is more dependable and less expensive than traditional cloud storage providers. They encrypt and distribute all files across a decentralized network. This means every uploader of files own their keys and own their data. No outside company or third party can access or control ones files.13131313BCN How is this different from centralized storage and why do you think it is needed now1313LU Centralized databases storage systems have typically been the ones handling data storage. They are physically run on one server and are controlled by a designated authority. But as customer demands continue to grow it is getting more difficult for the data center industry to ensure higher uptimes while maintaining security and keeping costs at a minimum. They are an easy target for hackers who can potentially gain access to a lot of data stored in one location.1313Talking about incentives only shareholders or board members of this centralized cloud company get to earn dividends unlike in decentralized blockchain solution where everyone can be given the opportunity to earn dividend1313BCN Who should use this type of storage1313LU Every user of the internet or someone that upload or save any type of file via the internet or on their device phone laptop iPad tablet desktop etc.1313BCN In your pitch you also introduce the concept of earning as you store. Can briefly explain what this entails and why this is necessary1313LU Centralized solutions like Microsoft Azure Google Cloud Amazon Web Service iCloud Dropbox etc. only comes with the incentive of storing users data and at a price considered to be cheap enough. On the other hand decentralized services like Sia Filecoin and Arweave come with an incentive from the centralized system and with additional incentives to storage space providers on their network.1313However at our company Stoor we have all the above as well as incentives to those uploading files. There are incentives for holders of our token app developers and platform owners which ensures all users in the ecosystem are covered. These opportunities and corresponding rewards speak to our companys core ethos The people who make up the entire ecosystem matter they must be rewarded.1313BCN What made you decide to venture into this business1313LU The world is obviously ready for web 3.0 and we are moving away from the web 2.0 era blockchain has shaped this for us all. However it becomes a concern when we see web 3.0 which should be independent and progressive continue to depend not on the blockchain but on centralized Amazon and Google cloud to store data for web 3.0 solutions.1313We have been getting more reports of these cloud providers being taken offline due to hackings or errors in upgrades while the companies never update us about the integrity of our stored data after each attempted hack or successful hack. At Stoor we believe it too risky for the world to depend mainly on these few centralized platforms. If we truly want to get into web 3.0 we need a solution that is web 3.0 driven1313BCN In your opinion is Africa and the rest of the world ready for blockchain storage1313LU The world is ready for a blockchain decentralized storage solution it is just that we have not had a perfect blend that captures all the participants in the ecosystem and we know our solution to be a better plan that captures all ecosystem participants in the area of data storage.1313BCN Jack Dorsey the founder of Twitter recently stirred controversy when he tweeted about the VCs role in building the Web3.0. Do you agree or disagree with what Dorsey said1313LU I respect Jack as a person and his bold vision. As a person and cofounder at Stoor I have taken the path to build and build with the mindset of putting the majority of the power of web3.0 to the people.1313What are your thoughts about this interview Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

As a result projects like Decentraland and The Sandbox which had already been established long before are already benefiting from this push.13Axie Infinity became one of the most played decentralized games during this year due to its playtoearn mechanics that appealed to people with low incomes in countries like the Philippines and Venezuela that perceived a higher income playing these than by occupying normal jobs in their countries.13Due to this success traditional gaming companies like Square Enix and Ubisoft are now trying to introduce these elements into their gaming ecosystems proposing to create token economies and marketplaces that would allow these universes to be selfsustainable in the future. However AAA gaming companies have not released an installment of a major franchise integrating NFTs yet.13What do you think about the rise of Defi Kingdoms and decentralized gaming Tell us in the comments section below.13",

The statement explains13The scope of the CBDC pilot was limited to wallet providers who indicated their readiness to participate within the scheduled timeframe. National Commercial Bank NCB based on the extent of their experience in the Sandbox came onboard with BOJ to test the range of services to be offered using the CBDC solution.13The statement also explains that the success of the pilot project had been dependent on whether a CBDC along with the attendant technology solution could be successfully implemented in Jamaica.131313230 Million Worth of CBDCs Minted13The statement reveals that three activities were completed during the pilot phase. The first of these activities was the minting of 230 million worth of CBDC to be issued to deposittaking institutions and authorized payment service providers. A day after minting the digital currency on August 9 2021 the BOJ went on to issue 1 million worth of CBDC which was distributed to the banks staff.1313Next on October 29 2021 about 5 million worth of the CBDC was issued to NCB and this marked the first issuance of a CBDC to a deposittaking institution in Jamaica.

    "title": "DeFi Lending | How It Works, Rates and Platforms",
    "content": "While the concept of financial 8216lending has been around for eons DeFi lending is a recent innovation and operates through the DeFi lending platform or DeFi protocols that offer cryptocurrency loans in a trustless manner.Unlike the regular financial ecosystem the DeFi space operates without any third part of central authority. DeFi lending allows the holders to stake their coins in the DeFi lending platforms for lending purposes and earn interests without intermediaries.DeFi or Decentralized Finance is an ecosystem of financial applications built on top of blockchain technology. The DeFi ecosystem started on the Ethereum network and is built on selfexecuting smart contracts that dont require a thirdparty intermediary. It relies on a peertopeer network to establish decentralized applications assets and protocols that provide a range of financial services and features similar to those offered by conventional banks and financial middlemen.Read on to get a closer look at how DeFi lending works and how it has pushed Finance in a new direction.How Does DeFi Lending WorkDeFi lending enables traders to volunteer their cryptocurrencies for lending purposes on the platform without a central authority having access to their data. It allows transparent and straightforward access to assets from anywhere in the world for every financial transaction without interference from a third party.DeFi has the maximum lending growth rate and offers lending benefits to both lenders and borrowers. It also provides margin trading opportunities allowing longterm investors to lend their assets while earning higher interest rates.These Defi protocols allow users to borrow loans at decreased rates. Users can exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency on centralized exchanges and then lend it on a decentralized exchange.Defi Lending PlatformsWhen utilizing DeFi protocols like Aave users interested in becoming 8220lenders8221 need to transfer their funds into what is known as a 8220money market8221 using a smart contract after which the tokens become available for borrowing to other users.Crypto financing allows investors to borrow cash or crypto assets by mortgaging their crypto holdings as collateral. The lender maintains ownership of the assets when using crypto lending. However the crypto provided as collateral cannot be moved during the loan period.nbspThe process is relatively simple and is described belowUsers lend cryptocurrency usually stablecoins to a lending platform to earn interest without paperwork.Contact is made with the lending platform and a loan is requested by a borrower.The borrower warrants cryptocurrency as insurance for the loan. The loan is then accepted and the crypto platform attaches the collateral. The borrower must repay the total amount before taking back the collateral fund.To maintain the collaterals value over the value of the loans the platform can liquidate the users loan into stablecoins if their collateral drops below a particular range.nbspBelow are some of the most popular DeFi lending platformsAaveLaunched in 2020 Aave is an opensource Ethereum based noncustodial DeFi lending protocol that allows its users to borrow assets while simultaneously earning interests on the assets they have to proffer to the protocol. The DeFi protocol enables lenders to accumulate assets in a pool and an equivalent amount of tokens is received in return.Algorithmically Aave adjusts the interest rates on cryptoassets according to the protocols demand and supply. The interest rate you earn through fund deposits may balance out the interest rate users accumulate by borrowing.With a total value of 18.44B and several tests and audits conducted by third parties Aave is considered one of the topmost secure DeFi protocols earning a security score of 95.MakerMaker is a unique Ethereum based DeFi lending platform that issues only the DAI token a stablecoin pegged with a 1. Maker has a secondary token MKR. Token holders can vote on issues of governance such as mending the stability fee and alternative risk parameters.nbspMaker is open to anyone creating a vault to deposit collaterals like USDC ETC or other assets and reproduce DAI against the collateral.nbspWith its total value notched at 15.74B and a security score of 85 Maker is one of the most secure platforms.CompoundCompound is an Ethereum based autonomous algorithmic DeFi lending application that utilizes a money market approach within the cryptocurrency world. It allows anyone to deposit assets into community liquidity pools and start trading and compiling interest without a fixed duration for a loan.Compound has a total value of 15.74B and is considered a secure platform with a security rating of 95.AlchemixAlchemix is a loanbased Ethereum DeFi platform that utilizes a new method in which loans are paid back automatically over time. In exchange for depositing DAI into a smart contract a token is given to the user representing the deposits potential future yield.You can access all these DeFi platforms through a CoinStats Wallet your gateway to DeFi allowing you to sell swap buy loan earn and track all your digital assets from a single location.nbspDeFi Lending RatesThe most significant advantage DeFi lending has over traditional financial lending is allowing its users to earn highinterest rates with earnings ranging between 5 and 15 APY Annual percentage yield.Earning Protocol FeesDeFi protocols charge modest fees for activities like the lending swapping and borrowing of assets. Several DeFi projects allocate a portion of the fees they earn to other users in exchange for providing liquidity.nbspData from CoinStats shows the interest rates and fees on different protocols. Today Aave Compound and Uniswap are amongst the highest earners based on Ethereum.Gas FeesGas fees or transactional fees are dues developers levy to process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain where the majority of DeFi transactions occur.In June 2020 the total gas fee needed to execute a transaction on Ethereum was equal to 0.45 while in September it saw an increase of 2686 making the new charge 12.54In the last quadrant of the year there was a drop in fees due to slowing activity but on January 4 2021 17.56 was recorded as the average gas fee per transaction the highest price recorded so far.The Ethereum yellow paper imposes that every transaction attracts a minimum of 21000 Gas which most platforms then adopt as their set default limit. A user must set a gas 8216limit and gas 8216used. The interrelation of these two will regulate the price 8211 the higher your gas limit is the faster your transactions will be processed.Source ycharts.comDeFi Lending RisksIts right to assume that DeFi lending offers one of the most reliable and attractive approaches to earning passive income with significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional financial institutions.nbsp However as with any financial institution there are several risks involved.Here are the three most significant risks everyone should know before lending crypto assetsImpermanent LossYou risk 8220impermanent loss8221 when investing your assets in a liquidity pool.Impermanent loss occurs when the assets an investor locks in a liquidity pool change price after being deposited. This creates a loss as opposed to simply holding assets in a crypto wallet by the liquidity provider.nbspThe risk of impairment loss relies heavily on the Automated Market Maker system used by popular liquidity pools. DeFi pools have to maintain a ratio of assets of two tokens. For example an ETHLINK pool may have a fixed ratio of 150 respectively so anyone wishing to offer liquidity in the pool would have to deposit both Ether and Link in the same ratio.Flash Loan AttacksFlash loans are a new generation of loans that dont require collateral.nbsp Flash loans utilize smart contracts to mitigate the risk associated with unsecured loans.However borrowers are required to repay the full loan borrowed back in the same transaction usually within a couple of seconds.nbsp The transaction is rolled back if the borrower fails to pay back the loan.DeFi RugPullsDeFi Rugpulls is a new type of exit scam in decentralized Finance.nbspDeFi platforms dont have regulations like traditional financial systems and the users trust in the platforms they choose to trade their assets on is usually breached through Rugpulls.A new cryptocurrency is created by developers and paired with a prominent cryptocurrency like Ether and then a liquidity pool is set up. People are encouraged to deposit their assets into the pool with promises of a highinterest yield. After extensive marketing carried on the newly created token the pool gains a substantial amount of the leading cryptocurrency.Back doors that are intentionally coded into the tokens smart contract are then used to mint millions of new coins and then sell the popular cryptocurrency.This act drains the top cryptocurrency in the pool thereby leaving millions of worthless coins in it and the developers disappearing without a trace.nbsp A famous example of Rugpull risks is when in 2020 the SushiSwap founder Chief Nomi liquidated his SUSHI tokens after gathering collateral worth more than a billion dollars.nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspHow to Avoid DeFi Lending ThreatsDespite the increase in financial scams there are several steps you can undertake to investigate the risks before investing in a lending platform.We have summed them up for youStep 1 Verify the teams integrity on other projects.Step 2 Carefully read through the projects whitepaper.Step 3 Check if a third party has audited the projects code.Step 4 Be conscious of red flags like nonrealistic interest rates overthetop promotions and marketing strategies.ConclusionDeFi lending is a genuinely captivating technology with the capacity of reshaping the worlds financial system. It attempts to decentralize the foundation of traditional financial services like trading investments lending borrowing and insurance.As the first global financial system shaped by its very population Decentralized Financial lending has created new prospects for the financial world with giant strides in financial possibilities.",

    "title": "What are Crypto Loans and How They Work",
    "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has come a long way from 2008 when it was envisioned by the mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto in the paper for Bitcoin. The journey has been nothing short of astronomical with cryptocurrencies giving financial freedom to people all across the globe. Cryptocurrencies have gained much more adoption in the past 5 years than the years before that with thousands of altcoins projects technologies etc. coming into the market. It is innovating the financial space with each passing year. Crypto loans are one such innovation where the users can get access to loans against their crypto assets known as Crypto Backed Loans and Crypto Loans without CollateralFlash Loans etc.Here we bring you all there is to know about cryptocurrencybacked loans and how you can get loans against crypto and the advantages and risks associated with them.nbspWhat is Crypto LoansIn order to understand what a crypto loan is it is important to understand what a conventional loan is and how it works. A conventional loan can be of two kinds Secured or Unsecured. Secured loans require security or collateral against them as a hedge in face of the loanee being unable to pay the loan back. Unsecured loans do not require security or collateral rather they are given out on the basis of the loanees CIBIL or credit scores.Thus a crypto loan is also similar to the conventional loan in a way that the underlying security or collateral needed to secure the loan is not a physical asset rather it is a cryptocurrency asset. There is also another kind of crypto loan known as a Flash Loan that is not secured by any asset and is operated on smart contracts. But when we speak of a crypto loan it refers to crypto secured loan.nbsp Image Credit BlockFi There are many platforms that act as a conduit for securing crypto loans such as BlockFi Celsius Aave Compound and even centralized exchanges such as Binance.Crypto Loan AdvantagesThe next big question that comes to mind is whether getting a crypto loan is a good idea or not. When it comes to cryptocurrency loans there are multiple options available to any user. They can choose to be either the borrower or the lender. Each of these roles has its advantages and disadvantages such asEarn InterestAs a lender there is a huge opportunity for people to earn interest on the loans they give. It is an easy way to earn a steady passive income by loaning out your crypto assets stable coins such as USDT or cash.nbspLowInterest RateFor borrowers crypto collateral loans serve as a very lucrative prospect as the interest rates are very low. For e.g. BlockFi offers a 4.5 percent APRAnnual Percentage Rate on the loan. Many other platforms also have a very lowinterest rate on their cryptocurrency loans when the loans are secured for the long term.nbspNo Need for BanksCryptocurrency loans empower people in a way where it takes the power of approval or denial of loans away from the banks and other financial institutions. Although the amount in the majority of cryptoassetbacked loans is usually above 10000 it still is very lucrative and gives access to people to funds that would take them a longtime to secure through conventional methods.nbspFast and SecureThe main issue with conventional loans is that they are very timeconsuming and not everyone can be assured of securing a loan. With cryptocurrency loans the time taken to get a loan is minimal and almost everyone can get one.Ownership of Crypto assetsIf someone holds a large number of crypto assets and is in need of cash then they do not need to sell their crypto assets. Rather they can secure cash loans by keeping their crypto assets as collateral and get them back after repaying the loan.nbspCrypto Loan DisadvantagesWhile cryptocurrency loans might seem very lucrative and the sensible thing to do when it comes to getting loans for people that dabble in the world of crypto. There are some inherent disadvantages associated with them. Some of these disadvantages arenbspHigh minimum loan amountWhen it comes to cryptocurrency loans the loan amount is usually high. It makes it that much riskier for people to think about getting one. Moreover in order to secure a cryptocurrency loan worth 10000 platforms such as BlockFi require a minimum cryptoasset holding worth 20000 in order to get approval for the loan.nbspShort Repayment PeriodMost cryptocurrency loans have a short repayment period ranging anywhere between 12 months to 3 years. When compared to conventional loans this time period is shorter and puts much more pressure on the borrower.nbspVolatile Nature of Crypto PricesThe crypto asset against which a loan is secured can go through massive volatility in their prices over the course of a loan period. If the price of the crypto asset drops below the threshold level set by the lender there is a risk of a Margin Call. If a margin call occurs the borrower might need to deposit more amount of that asset in order to fulfill the loan requirements. If the borrower fails to do so the platform can choose to sell your assets to recuperate its losses.nbspCrypto Assets are lockedOnce a loan is secured against a crypto asset they are locked in for the entire duration of the loan. During which the borrower can no longer access their assets and use them for trading and other purposes. In case the price of your asset goes to the moon you wont be able to sell them. Likewise if the price drops substantially you wont be able to sell them to cut short your losses.nbspConclusionWhile cryptocurrency loans are very easy to secure and have a lot of inherent advantages while giving financial liberation to people across the globe. The mechanism and the platforms offering them are still at a very nascent stage. Moreover the volatile nature of crypto assets that form the backbone of cryptocurrency loans makes them a very risky endeavor. Even if you are a lender that wants to earn interest by lending their crypto assets it is a much better idea to hold your assets on CoinStats Wallet and earn interest on your holdings. And on top of that manage all your crypto assets across different platforms using the CoinStats Wallet and App.nbsp",

    "title": "DeFi Stocks and How to Invest in It",
    "content": "DeFi Decentralised Finance refers to an ecosystem of financial applications built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Developed on a transparent and trustless blockchain network it aims to operate in a decentralized way without the dependency on middlemen in financial transactions.DeFi uses opensource technologies blockchain and protocols to achieve the goal of decentralization. Smart contracts encode the terms and activities necessary for agreement between buyers and sellers or lenders and borrowers. These services are conducted through specific codes rather than by a bank or other institution manually.Regardless of the technology or platform used the main goal of DeFi systems is to remove intermediaries between transacting parties.DeFi is an excellent innovation with limitless possibilities and a wide range of financial services.nbspDeFi or Decentralized Finance stocks are a great form of investment if you research well which DeFi stocks to buy. Lets dive into the detailsWhy Should You Invest in DeFi StocksThere are different reasons to invest in DeFi stocks. Lets see why investing in them is a great ideaAccess to LoansNot everyone has a bank account or qualifies for a loan from a traditional financial institution. Procuring loans from banks can be very difficult and is not an altogether great idea.In contrast DeFi stocks provide accessibility to loans regardless of location. All you need is internet connectivity.nbspReduced Interest Rates and FeesDeFi platforms offer an excellent alternative to traditional finances high transaction fees and interest rates. They allow direct transactions between two parties without intermediaries thereby helping to reduce transaction fees and offering favorable interest rates to borrowers and lenders.Efficient Security and TransparencyDeFi uses smart contracts to create protocols that replicate existing financial services in a more open interoperable and transparent way. The smart contracts are available on the blockchain providing an immutable transparent financial ledger as a reference whenever needed.nbspFunctional and Decentralized AutonomyThe most significant advantage of DeFi over traditional finance is its nonreliance on regularized money institutions like Central Banks.Time has shown that modern stock markets can crash as epitomized by the stock market crash of 2008. Their fallibility can be linked to the interdependency on volatile national governments with even more volatile financial and economic policies.Unfavorable government policies corruption and potential bankruptcy are other disadvantages of investing with centralized financial institutions.DeFi offers an alternative to centralized finance. Investing in Defi stocks automatically mitigates most of the risks associated with traditional financial investing.nbspHow to Invest in DeFi StocksLets discuss several ways of investing in DeFi stocks below.Buy a DeFi TokenThe most straightforward way to invest is to buy a DeFi coin such as Ether or any other.Purchasing anbsp DeFi token gives you access to almost all the DeFi industry.Deposit in Liquidity PoolsAfter purchasing a relevant token you can deposit it into lending reserves called liquidity pools to earn passive income.Market liquidity refers to the trading rate i.e. buying and selling tokens within the market. The higher the market liquidity the better the chances of making a trade and profit.nbspDepositing a relevant trading pair means contributing to a liquidity pool. The higher your deposits and the longer you leave them in reserve the more profit on the interest you make.nbspYield FarmingThe high demand for deposited tokens within DeFi networks is among the reasons for the popularity of yield farming.nbspParticipants deposit tokens on highpaying DeFi platforms or networks with excellent interest rates. After that they keep a close watch on the fluctuating incentives and interest rates on their platforms and other platforms.Once yield farmers notice that a different platform offers more favorable rates they go on to maximize their earnings by transferring their crypto deposits to the relevant DeFi network. This is done per interest fluctuations networkwide.nbspDeciding Protocols on Governance TokensAnother great way to invest in DeFi is to decide on the future of the governing protocols. Many DeFi platforms offer the globally distributed and decentralized community of stakeholders governance tokens thereby giving them agency responsibility and control of platform management.Lets view buying UNI Uniswapnbsp as an example. Uniswap is a governance token meaning that when you hold it in reserve you can vote on the tokens protocols. Your decisionmaking ability is proportional to your Uniswap holdings. As the platform gains in popularity and value more Uniswap holdings will be required to make proactive decisions on its future.Popular DeFi Stocks to Invest InThere are several DeFi stocks you can invest in depending on your preference. Here are a few of the most popular onesAaveAave is the most popular DeFi token and is considered the bank of the cryptocurrency industry. As one of the most prominent DeFi blockchains Aave has more crypto reserves than any other platform.Aave allows its users to deposit crypto tokens to earn passive interest. In addition users can lend their tokens to access collateralized loans. This further helps users to leverage their crypto holdings and positions.nbspUniswapUniswap is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain.Uniswaps smart contract protocol facilitates the financial interaction with Ethereum wallets creating anbsp secure permissionless and trustless way to trade crypto.nbspDeFi Pulse IndexDeFi Pulse Index is a tokenized asset a crypto exchangetraded fund that allows you to handpick your DeFi stock investments. You can buy it on Uniswap.nbspnbspCurveCurve is an AMM Automated Market Maker that allows you to transact stablecoins like USDC and DAI with reduced fees and slippage. Several other DeFi networks run on Curve.nbspnbspnbspYearn.financeYFI provides decentralized lending services yield farming and decentralized insurance. It deploys users crypto reserves in other decentralized finance protocols like Compound dydx and Aave to provide the most favorable market interest rates.nbspYFI has come into existence since DeFis early days and has become one of the most valuable tokens on the cryptocurrency market today. Yearn.finance YFI has a market cap of 1.2 billion and its value is 34498.53.How to Use DeFiThe best way to learn using DeFi is to interact with DeFi platforms.DApps decentralized applications are easy to use. You dont even have to create an account to use them your Ethereum wallet will suffice. MetaMask is a good choice for an eWallet as it has a browser extension on Chrome that you can use.After transferring your tokens to your wallet you can access DeFi platforms with only a handful clicks. You will only have to synchronize your Ethereum wallet to the selected platform and start enjoying the benefits of DeFi.ConclusionTrading is easy on platforms like CoinStats. You can link your Metamask Binance and Coinbase accounts to your CoinStats accounts for seamless trading.nbspYou can also learn more about trading platforms crypto exchanges DeFi tokens etc. from our CoinStats blog.However despite its growing popularity DeFi tech is not failsafe and you can lose all your money if you invest in a DeFi platform thats not secure enough. As they rely on smart contractsnbsp DeFi startups can also fail due to programming errors.Nevertheless new DeFi programs address the deficiencies resulting from a lack of adequate insurance and offer Decentralized Insurance as a new way of protecting against loss of funds from faulty smart contracts.nbsp",

    "title": "15 Biggest Crypto Exchanges by Average Daily Volume 2021",
    "content": "2021 was a defining year for everything crypto and DeFi. We saw the emergence and rapid growth of a great number of projects and exchanges and ultimately came to see the future of digital currencies in Web3 a blockchainintegrated internet intermeshed with reality.nbspWith so many exciting things going on so many new exchange platforms and users making a decision about which crypto exchange to use has become quite tricky. In this respect we at CoinStats think it pays to take into account average daily volume of each platform in 2021. It is after all a significant metric that shows users trust and the platforms reliability.nbspLets go over the 15 biggest exchanges of 2021 by average daily volumenbsp1. Binance 27.53 BBinance has been around for about four years and is by now the crypto exchange platform that needs no introductions The most popular exchange with relatively low fees and a wide selection of currencies had an average daily volume of 27.53 billion in 2021 which is around three times more than the next biggest exchange. Quite impressive dont you think One possible con when it comes to Binance is that its designed for experienced users and it wont be easy for a beginner to make sense of its complex interface.nbsp2. Huobi Global 7.58 BWith an average daily volume of 7.58 billion Huobi Global was the second biggest crypto exchange in 2021 and for good reason. Extremely secure and with excellent customer support Huobi has an extensive set of features for a user to explore. Another major perk is that they work hard to keep their fees low which is of course every traders primary concern. On the flip side the platform has low withdrawal limits and isnt available for US residents. Oh wellnbsp3. Coinbase 4.33 BThe third exchange on our list Coinbase is licensed in the U.S. and fully regulated. Setting out to 8220increase economic freedom in the world8221 does pay off it seems The platform enjoyed an average daily volume of 4.33 billion in 2021. Coinbase enjoys high liquidity and is easy to get started with no matter the users background.nbsp The two major cons of Coinbase are that unless one has Coinbase Pro the fees are significantly high and that the available trading options are pretty limited.nbsp4. Bitrue 2.17 BNext up we have Bitrue a Singaporebased crypto exchange founded in 2018. 2.17 billion in average daily volume in 2021 isnt that bad especially considering the platform was hacked back in 2019. Luckily the exchange soon reimbursed all lost funds and added extra security layers. Bitrue offers a myriad of features competitive fees and high interest rates to investors so its no wonder its 4 on our list.nbsp5. XT.COM 2.12 BWith .2.12 billion in average daily volume in 2021 XT.com is almost tied with Bitrue. Some of the advantages of XT.com include a highperformance matching engine that ensures the speed of transactions a truly caring customer care team and a beginnerfriendly interface. That being said the platform isnt wellpublicized so a lot of the nitty gritty needs to be figured out on the go.nbsp6. FTX 1.71 BThe sixth exchange on our list is FTX a diversified exchange founded in The Bahamas in May of 2019. A daily average of 1.71 billion in 2021 puts FTX in the roughly same category of players as Kraken and KuCoin. While the platform isnt available in the U.S. and has relatively high USD withdrawal fees the rest of the world can enjoy topnotch security an easy and quick swapping process and even an NFT marketplace.nbsp7. Kraken 1.63 BKraken is on par with FTX and KuCoin when it comes to average daily volume in 2021. Founded only two years after Bitcoin Kraken is a longtime player in the market that caters to experienced users and newbies alike. Both secure and convenient the U.S. crypto exchange is one of the best places to margin trade which is something advanced traders will surely appreciate.nbsp8. KuCoin 1.63 BNumber 8 on our list is KuCoin a wellknown secure innovative and userfriendly platform with over 8 million users. The platform averaged 1.63 billion per day in 2021 which is pretty low considering the modest fees wide range of coins and many advanced features available. On the con side the platform is not licensed in the U.S. and you may run into some server issues.nbsp9. Bitfinex 1.27 BBitfinex is no doubt one of the oldest players in this niche so the fact that it has had to recover from multiple cyber attacks and tighten up its security to earn users trust again is a given. That being said thanks to the numerous advanced features of the exchange trading on Bitfinex is really wellsuited for intermediate to highvalue investors. The Hong Kongbased centralized exchange averaged 1.27 billion in daily volume in 2021.nbspnbsp10. Crypto.com 1.23 BEvery single day in 2021 there were about 1.23 billion worth of trades on Crypto.com. While beginners might find the advanced functionality of the exchange overwhelming at first the learning curve is rewarding in the end. Crypto.com supports more than 150 cryptocurrencies prides itself on low fees and even has its own coin.11. Gate.io 1.18 BCreated in China back in 2013 Gate.io is one of the fastest growing exchanges in the world. About 1.18 billion worth of trades occured on Gate.io every single day in 2021. The platform is easy enough to navigate and even has several modes like Beginner and Pro. Over time Gate.io has had to work on enhancing its security and now investors can have a peace of mind if they choose the exchange.nbsp12. Binance.us 0.79 BnbspNumber 12 on our list is Binance.us an exchange created specifically for users from the US. In 2021 the exchange averaged 0.79 billion in trades every day. While advanced users may find that the exchange doesnt provide access to some of the popular assets theyd want to invest in Binance.us does support 50 cryptocurrencies with very low fees.nbsp13. Gemini 0.24 BLaunched back in 2015 in the US Gemini has significantly grown and averaged 0.24 billion worth of trades every single day. No matter if youre a newbie or an experienced trader Geminis versatility guarantees that youll find something to your liking. A pretty cool bonus  the platform has its adjacent educational resource a 8220Cryptopedia8221 that has some highquality resources for DeFi enthusiasts.nbsp14. Bybit 0.16 BIt is no secret that Bybit exchange platform being young is somewhat limited in features but it also has a lot of advantages for example a simplicity of use and good options for margin trading. We cant wait to see what Bybit grows into there is a lot of potential here For now though 0.16 billion in daily trading in 2021 is a great start.nbsp15. Bitkub 0.13 BThis Thailandbased exchange platform was founded in the beginning of 2018 and has 26 coins listed. Bitkub welcomes users from all over the world offers high liquidity and shows great progress when it comes to trading numbers. Were sure the 0.13 billion daily average in 2021 is nothing compared to what 2022 has in store for Bitkub.",

    "title": "What Are Flash Loans",
    "content": "Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has immense potential apart from being just assets that one can invest and tradein. What many people fail to realize is that investment and trading cryptocurrency tokens are just a small part of the technology. Blockchain technology is here to revolutionize the way people see banking and finances. It aims to truly empower people and provide them financial freedom. And in this regard one of the most important aspects is how people get their hands on loans. This is where Flash Loans come into place. In this article we will reveal the answers to questions such as what are flash loans and what they can do for people and developers.nbspDecentralized Finance or DeFi as it is commonly called among the niche experts and enthusiasts alike aims at changing how finances are seen across the world. It is building towards giving people the power over their finances without the interference of a centralized authority like a bank etc. Flash loans are one such way in which DeFi space wishes to bring change in the world of finance.What Is A Flash LoanThe first thing to understand when it comes to a flash loan is understanding what it is. And in order to understand how DeFi flash goals work one needs to understand how a normal loan works. So what is a loan and how does it work In simple words a loan is a borrowed amount that an individual business or institution takes from another person business or entity. This borrowed amount is to be paid back within a previously stipulated time period at a rate of interest agreed before. The institution or individual that is providing the loan keeps or demands something from the loanee as collateral in case they dont return the loan and interest.nbspIn a normal loan there are institutions such as banks firms etc. that act as middlemen or facilitators for these loans. And in return they are paid for their services. Thus this makes the entire system very centralized as in most cases it is the banks that are providing the loans themselves.nbspFlash LoanDeFi Flash Loans are the answer to the centralized nature of the loan business. Therefore to put it in simple words the answer to the question as to what is a flash loan is simple. A flash loan is a trading instrument where a borrower can borrow from a lender without the involvement of any third party or middlemen.nbspDecentralized Finance is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology. It is slowly but steadily getting a lot of traction and adoption on a global scale. El Salvador became the first country recently to declare Bitcoin as a legal tender. And for a much larger mass adoption for cryptocurrencies DeFi flash loan is one of the easiest ways.nbspImage Credits Aave Flash Loansnbsp nbspnbspWhat separates a DeFi flash loan from conventional bank loans is that the flash loans are totally unsecured. In traditional banking systems loans are of two kinds secured and unsecured. In secured bank loans the borrower needs to provide securitycollateral to secure a loan. For unsecured bank loans there is no need for collateral or security. Rather these loans are provided depending upon the loanees past CIBILCRIF scores.Flash loans are unsecured but that does not mean that the lender will lose everything if the loanee doesnt pay it back. Flash loans work on some predetermined conditions embedded in the smart contracts that execute them. And in case the loanee defaults then the loaned amount is returned to the lender and it is like the loan never ever took place.nbspAttributes of DeFi Flash LoansDeFi flash loan or crypto flash loan as it is more commonly called is a shortterm loan hence the term flash is associated with it. Let us have a much deeper look into the attributes or aspects of flash loans in order to understand them better. The major factors that govern and define flash loans areGoverned by Smart ContractsDefi flash loans are governed by smart contacts over the blockchain. The smart contracts are executed when all the underlying conditions in the smart contract are met. This is what ensures that the lender does not suffer any losses. The smart contract reverses if the loanee fails to repay and the loaned amount is returned to the lenders account.nbspInstantaneous in NatureFlash loans are instantaneous in nature. This is what gives it its name. All the loans secured under flash loans already have the transaction or trade they are meant for. And as soon as the loanee receives the loan the transaction has to be completed within a short period of time generally which is in seconds. Moreover the entire process of flash loan transactions from applying using and returning to the lender happens within a very short span of time.nbspNo SecurityCollateral RequiredUnlike the majority of normal or conventional loans flash loans do not require the loanee to put any security or collateral up in order to secure the loan. As long as the underlying conditionalities of the smart contract are met the loan process is executed smoothly and without any need for middlemen guarantees etc. The smart contract is guaranteed enough for the loan to go through.nbspThese are the three main attributes of a flash loan. And to sum it up we can say that decentralized finance makes flash loans possible by employing smart contracts execute over the blockchain in order to provide people access to quick and easy loans without the need for any collateral or waiting period.nbspNow that we know what flash loans are and understand what governs them let us look into how to get yourself a flash loan.nbspHow to Get a Flash LoanAs easy as it might sound it is not possible for an everyday user to get a flash loan. In order to get a flash loan it is necessary to have knowledge of how to code a smart contract. There are platforms such as Aave dYdX etc. that let the users secure flash loans for themselves.

While in the case of borrowers they can get access to uncollateralized loans without dealing with the hassles of a middleman.nbspnbspnbspnbspImage Credits dYdX HomepageNow that we are well versed with what flash loans are and how to get one let us get into what is it that makes flash loans so lucrative and what are the most common uses of flash loans.nbspUses of a Flash LoanThe most common uses of flash loans are as followsArbitrage TradeThere are always price discrepancies for cryptocurrency tokens across different exchanges. These differences can be due to time differences trading volumes etc. Therefore a cryptocurrency trader can take advantage of this price difference and earn profits. This is called arbitrage trading where a trader secures a flash loan of a cryptocurrency token on the exchange with a lower price and sells it on the exchange with the higher price and after returning the initial loan pockets the profit for themselves.nbspSave Transaction FeesIn many cases such as transactions on the Ethereum blockchain the transaction costs can be very high. Expert users and traders bypass this and save a lot of money on transaction costs by getting a flash loan for the required cryptocurrency as flash loans have very low fees.nbspSwap CollateralMany expertlevel users and traders also make use of flash loans to make money by swapping the lowquality collateral of one loan with the highquality collateral of another. This is one of the most advanced use cases of flash loans and is slowly gaining popularity amongst users.nbspRisks Associated with Flash LoansFlash loans might sound exciting and like an opportunity to make some quick money due to the fastpaced nature of flash loan transactions. It is equally important to keep in mind that there are risks associated with them. The most important and dangerous threat to flash loans and the DeFi ecosystem is the Flash Loan Attack.nbspFlash Loan AttackA flash loan works without collateral and it relies on the smart contract for its fair execution. Therefore the strength of a flash loan lies in the smart contract. But this has also proven to be its greatest weakness as well. Some hacker or cyber attacker can alter the smart contract and make away with the cryptocurrency tokens that have been loaned under that particular smart contract. There have been such attacks in the past on exchanges and platforms offering flash loans. The two of the most prominent examples of Flash Loan Attack are1. dYdX Flash Loan Attack dYdX is a decentralized lending app DApp and the attack occurred in 2020 when the attacker used multiple different DeFi protocols to manipulate the market. Here no smart contract was tampered with rather the attacker used different DeFi protocols to breach the rules of the smart contract.nbsp2. PancakeBunny Flash Loan Attack PancakeBunny is a DeFi yield farming platform. The attack happened in May 2021 when the attacker purchased a bulk of BNB tokens and using them manipulated the prices of USDTBNB and BUNNYBNB tokens. This manipulation helped the attacker to assimilate a large number of BUNNY tokens which were then dumped to create an artificial price crash. Doing this according to BSCScan data the attacker made away with 3 million US Dollars.nbspThus it is evidently clear that even though flash loans are a great tool when it comes to enabling mass adoption of cryptocurrencies blockchain technology and DeFi. It is still very early and its nascent stage. It is still prone to attacks such as above. What makes it a bit more difficult to mass adopt is its complex nature which is not easy to comprehend for someone that has no technical or coding knowledge.nbsp",

Lets look into them.nbspCFDs A Beginners GuideA contract for Difference or CFD is typically made between a buyer and seller specifying that the buyer is required to pay the seller the difference if anynbsp between the current value of an asset and its value at the time the contract took place.nbspInstead the seller will have to pay the buyer if the difference is negative.nbspCFD is a popular and riskreduced way of trading that allows traders and investors an opportunity to profit from price movement without owning the underlying assets. The value of a CFD contract doesnt consider the assets underlying value only the price change between the trade entry and exit. Profit is made if as an investor you can accurately predict the direction of price movements while wrong guesswork will incur losses on your part.nbspCFDs operate by allowing investors to leverage or stake a marginal amount of assets to control a larger amount in the market.nbspCFD prices are usually in pairs termed as ask and bid prices. Ask prices are the lowest amount a seller will amount on an asset while bid prices are the highest amount a buyer is willing to pay.nbspAn estimated 7489 of retail investor accounts lose their money when trading CFDs. As a firsttime investor you should consider how CFDs work and if they are worth the enormous financial risk before you venture into it.ConclusionWith its rising popularity and fastgrowing pace the virtual reality ecosystem with its freemarket economy and native token is a unique and exciting venture within the Ethereum blockchain system.Decentraland is predicted to become a multipurpose metaverse where businesses can advertise and monetize digital content. The rising popularity of NFTs nonfungible tokens brings more value to MANA with the increasing popularity of Decentraland.However it also comes with a handful of issues the biggest being the shockingly high gas fees to purchase MANA which makes playing a bit problematic.nbspAlso clothing customization for avatars is fun but requires you to buy MANA that costs a whopping 60 with several other items of clothing costing several thousands of US dollars worth of MANA.nbspWith this said and regulatory risks remaining high for virtual cryptocurrencies like MANA it undoubtedly gives investors several incentives to invest in it.",
